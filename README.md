# AnimeScraper
Scrapes animes from http://anime-joy.tv and displays them.

Notice:
I made this just to see if I could just to educate myself in NodeJS and Express, none of the actual shows are hosted on the site itself, it is scraped using Request and parsed using cheerio. If you have any ideas of how to fix some of the problems I would be so happy to be able to see how you did it!
